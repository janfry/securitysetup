This site was inspired by the rather excellent [The Setup][1], a site which seeks to find out "What do people use to get stuff done?". It occasionally features people within the security industry but not frequently enough to satiate my desire.

I spend inordinate amounts of time trying to figure out what the optimal setup is for my line of work - Use tools natively or use a VM like Kali or both, how best to back up data and tools, how to store data securely, to use Burp or ZAP, which scripting language to useâ€¦ The list is endless.

With the blessing of The Setup's [creator][2], I decided to start this site to find out how the best in the business "do their thing"... Be it attacking, defending, building, breaking, hacking, cracking or {insert your subject of interest in security}.

If you'd like to submit your setup, please fill in the following [GitHub Issues Template][3]. You'll obviously need a GitHub account to do so!
