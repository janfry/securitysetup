The template questions are:

- Who are you, and what do you do?
- What hardware do you use?
- And what software?
- What would be your dream setup?

Feel free to make your answers as short/long as you like. On average (based off a very unscientific review of The Setup), the first question will be a couple of paragraphs and the second and third will be 3-5 paragraphs. Images welcome too.

Optional questions:
- How do you streamline your workflow? Any tricks for being efficiency, maintaining "flow", employing something like "first order retrievablility" etc.
- Is there anything you want to plug? Products, blogs, tools, podcasts, whatever you like.
