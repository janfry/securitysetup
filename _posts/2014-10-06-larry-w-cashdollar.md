**Who are you, and what do you do?**

I’m [Larry W. Cashdollar][1].  I’m a hobbyist vulnerability researcher, exploit coder. For my day job I work in the CSIRT group at [Akamai Technologies][2].  I mostly enjoy legacy Unix systems, but recently I’ve been looking at ruby gems.  I think I’ve contributed around [75 CVEs][3] since 1998 ranging from /tmp race conditions to remote buffer overflows.

**What hardware do you use?**

I have an 8 core AMD Athlon with 8GB of RAM and 750GB of disk. I also have various laptops from a 486 dx100 to a 2 CPU 1.6GHz  HP netbook. I’ve also got 2 dual core x86 desktops with 4GB of RAM each and various rooted Android devices ranging from [Droid Bionics][4] to my sons old [Nabi Tab][5].I also have three [Raspberry PI’s][6].

**And what software?**

A few flavors of Linux running under Virtual Box, but I also run Solaris x86.  I think I've got Windows XP and Vista running too.  My website www.vapid.dhs.org is running on a Raspberry PI with an HTTP server I wrote in C.  It's behind Akamai's CDN so you could say I have the smallest origin on the largest CDN.

**What would be your dream setup?**  
A collection of Legacy Unix systems, Dec Alpha, HP, SGI, RS6000 all running IRIX, HP-UX,AIX etc.
