**Who are you, and what do you do?**

I am [Raaka ][1]aka Ravi Kiran, I am an information security engineer for a small company in Hyderabad, India and I am the creator of [HackerStrip][2].

I mostly deal with IDS, Linux hardening, Hypervisors, [OpenStack ][3]and vulnerability analysis.

I spend lot of time reading security blogs, comics watching Animal Planet, also I am a long distance runner.

I currently live in Indonesia where the Internet is pretty bad.

**What hardware do you use?**

My everyday machine is a [MacBook Pro][4] 13inch 2014 model. I also have a [Mac Mini][5] 2014 which runs Open Stack on it and an [Intel NUC][6] with [connectify.me][7] and Bit Torrent.

**And what software?**

Most regularly I use [IDA Pro][8], OpenStack, [VMWare ][9]and [VirtualBox][10], [Adobe Photoshop][11] for creating [HackerStrip][2], [Wireshark][12], T-shark and good old [Nmap][13].

**What would be your dream setup?**

Like a few guests, I like a portable setup. From the technology that is available now, I really like the look of the [Razor Blade][14] 14inch and the high-end [Mac Pro][15] 2014 with XEON and 32gb RAM :).
