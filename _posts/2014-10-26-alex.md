**Who are you, and what do you do?**

My name is Alex and I am a social engineer and pentester. Our main services are web app, VPN and WLAN pentesting, social engineering workshops, live hacking and cybersecurity checks. Besides that I am also working on a few different online companies, but these are right now in the startup phase.

**What hardware do you use?**

I don't use much hardware at all. In my office I use an old AMD 1090T with a 128GB SSD for my OS and a Samsung 750GB HDD just to store some data. A normal keyboard from a local store for under 10$ and a Logitech mouse. I also have a [Cyborg R.A.T 5][2] but I don't use it very often, I just bought it a few years ago for gaming on my laptop. The office computer also has 8GB of RAM with is more than enough for what I use it. Overall I just do research on this machine in combination with a 22" Samsung monitor.

My laptop is an ASUS with Intel Core i7, 8GB RAM and 1TB hdd I just bought it like that in the store and I am very happy with it. Nothing special about it.

For backup I use 3 different 2TB external HDDs. So I will backup on HDD 1 on Friday, the next week on HDD 2 and so on.... important files are also saved in the cloud, encrypted with [Boxcryptor][3].

I also have 2 tablets, a [Google Nexus 7][4] and [Samsung Tab 3][5] but those are just for surfing the web and looking up infos when I am not in the office.

For a phone I use a [Samsung Galaxy S4][6] and [Xcover 2][7].

**And what software?**

On my office computer I run [Elementary OS][8] with just the default tools. My main tool there is my browser which right now is [Firefox ][9]and [Thunderbird ][10]to handle a few mail accounts.

Some Addons I use are: [NoScript][11], [LastPass][12] (to handle all my passwords), [Adblock][13], [HTTPS Everywhere][14] and a Download Manager.

The host OS on the laptop is Win 8.1 with just a few tools like Microsoft Office Suite and VirtualBox. Other useful tools are:

1. [Samurai WTF][15] (VM)
2. [Kali ][16](VM)
3. [Mantra Browser][17]
4. [Tweetdeck][18]
5. [Notepad ++][19]
6. [BoxCryptor][3]

I also use [mega.co.nz][20] to store some data which I need to access at any time.

**What would be your dream setup?**

I looked at a few different laptops and tried them but nothing was as good as I wanted it to be, but ideally I would want:

1. Microsoft Surface Pro 3 which 1TB flash storage, 16gb RAM and a quad-core processor
2. 2x 27" LED monitor
3. Keyboard and mouse
4. 3 x 3TB SSD Drives
5. Surface Pro 3 Docking Station
6. Samsung S5
7. 5x USB 3 Sticks with 32GB
